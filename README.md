## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My Process

During the development of this age calculator app, I followed a structured and organized approach to ensure the project's success. Below is a brief overview of my process:

### Planning and Design
- Analyzed the project requirements and established a clear understanding of the desired functionalities and features.
- Reviewed the provided design assets and determined the best way to implement the responsive layout.
- Outlined a plan for structuring the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### Development
- Set up the project structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Implemented a mobile-first approach and developed the HTML structure with semantic markup.
- Styled the app using SASS custom properties and Flexbox for a responsive and visually appealing layout.
- Developed JavaScript functionality for form validation, age calculation, and user interface interactivity.

### Testing and Debugging
- Tested the app across different devices and browsers to ensure consistent user experience.
- Debugged and resolved any issues that arose during testing, refining the app's functionality and design.

### Refinement and Optimization
- Reviewed and optimized the code for readability, maintainability, and performance.
- Ensured that the app adhered to best practices in web development.

### Deployment
- Pushed the final version of the app to GitHub and shared the solution URL on Frontend Mentor.

Throughout the entire process, I focused on learning new techniques, refining my skills, and delivering a polished and functional age calculator app.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use Js and JQuery to create this functionnality

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Useful resources

- [JQuery](https://api.jquery.com/) - This helped me for to slect DOM Element more easily than with Vanilla JS reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
